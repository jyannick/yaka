# Yaka

Simple todo-list that helps you focus on your tasks, not on managing them.

[Try it here](https://jyannick.github.io/yaka/)

## Usage

Most operations can be performed using mouse/touchscreen. But if you use Yaka regularly, I suggest learning the keyboard shortcuts that are detailed in the help screen.

## Webapp version

You can use Yaka without installing anything, just use [the webapp hosted on github](https://jyannick.github.io/yaka/).

## Electron app

If you want, you can install the Electron App to have a desktop version of Yaka. It is designed to always be a keypress away:

- when minimized in the system tray, press `Ctrl-Alt-Y` to display the Yaka window
- once you are done with it, `Ctrl-W`, `Ctrl-M` or `Alt-F4` will send it back to the tray
- to close it, right-click on the icon in the tray and select `Quit`

This allows you to interact with your todo-list from anywhere, without having to grab the mouse.

## Privacy

Your data remains on your own computer:

- stored in your browser local storage when using the webapp
- or in the electron app local storage

It is never sent over the internet, and you do not need to create an account to use Yaka.

However, this means that your data will NOT be synchronized across multiple devices/browsers.
